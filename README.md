# ei-smartphone-motion-project

This was a project to play around and get a first feel of edge impulse, and tbh it's nicer than expected.
This project uses an accelerometer to classify between:
* left-right motion
* up-down motion
* circular motion

The data was collected and deployed on a smartphone, so it's recommended that if you plan to apply the project to a microcontroller you generate your own data. View the complete project on Edge Impulse [here](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/124439/latest).

As for this repository, it contains the neural networks, engineered feature data, and some visualizations.
