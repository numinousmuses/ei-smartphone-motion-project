Motion Detection using Edge Impulse
This was a project to play around and get a first feel of edge impulse, and tbh it's nicer than expected.
This project uses an accelerometer to classify between:
* left-right motion
* up-down motion
* circular motion
The data was collected and deployed on a smartphone, so it's recommended that if you plan to apply the project to a microcontroller you generate your own data.
